Question 1:
What is the definition of Machine Learning according to Arthur Samuel ?

Answer:
According to Arthur Samuel machine learning is defined as a Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is also a type of Artificial Intelligence that enables the programmers to write program in a more simple way. It focuses more on developing programs that teach computers to change when exposed to new data and to grow. Its goal is to understand and follow the methods by using algorithms to do that task automatically without any human help.


Question 2:
What is the definition of Machine Learning according to Tom Mitchell ?

Answer:
According to Tom Mitchell machine learning is defined as It is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. He also mentioned that "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E" An algorithm can be thought of as a set of rules/instructions that a computer programmer specifies, which a computer is able to process. Simply put, machine learning algorithms learn by experience, similar to how humans do. 


Question 3:
Using an example of machine learning problem (Anything that you can pose) explain it using the terms in question2 in your own words.

Answer:
Machine Learning is used for recognizing photos , videos, text and speech. Identifying people by face recognition algorithm, computer identify people from there individual photo this feature is used by facebook for tagging people. Here computer has just given with an algorithm and using those algorithm and experience ,it is able to perform task which also helps to improves the experience. In medical field also machine learning is used to predict disease, based on all the previous records and details computer is able to predict the disease by performing some task.
