Questions:
Describe at least 2 real life examples of supervised/unsupervised learning, clustering,classification problems (explain clearly and elaboratively).

Answer:

Supervised learning =>

Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
                                                                y=f(x)
The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.
It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process

Examples:
1)All the recommendations at Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Youtube, etc. contains supervised learning techniques.
2)Predicting housing price from a given dataset of some or lot of given existing house’s price,recommendation system.

Unsupervised Learnig =>

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.
The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. The clusters are modeled using a measure of similarity which is defined upon metrics such as Euclidean or probabilistic distance.
The machine learns through observation & find structures in data.

Examples:
1) We have a bunch of photos with information about what is on them and then you train a model to recognize new photos.
2) We have a bunch of molecules and information about which are drugs and you train a model to answer whether a new molecule is also a drug.

Classification =>

A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
Examples:
1) classifying whether a patient has disease or not
2) classifying whether an email is spam or not

Clusterings =>

 A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data
Examples:
1) grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
2) Spam filter:We know the junk folder in your email inbox? It is the place where emails that have been identified as spam by the algorithm.
